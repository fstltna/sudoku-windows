  Play Sudoku on your computer or print out the game sheets to play the old fashion way. Sudoku is the short form for the Japanese sentence "Suji wa dokushin ni kagiru", what can be translated as "all numbers have to happen exactly once". It is a logic puzzle which resembles the magical squares. The first known Sudoku-like game was developed by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler under the name "Latin Square" in the 18th century. After that there were further variants again and again, but very popular it became in Japan within the 1980s. Meanwhile it enjoys worldwide popularity.
